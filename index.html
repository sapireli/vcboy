<p>Hello. My name is Eliran Sapir. </p>
<p>You can send me email at e (at) vcboy (dot) com. I will always try and respond.</p>
<p>I tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/eliransapir">here</a>, and list what I work on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/eliransapir">here</a>. </p>
<p>I subscribe to <a href="http://blogmaverick.com/">Mark Cuban</a>, <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/">James Altucher</a> and <a href="http://cdixon.org/">Chris Dixon</a>.</p>
<p>Know this rule of thumb: buy low sell high. That and stay away from non-entrepreneur VCs.</p>
<p>I hate losing more than I love winning, this makes starting a new company really hard when you have 10 great ideas that you reduced from a thousand. My solution: found a partner that picked one.</p>
<p>The secret boils down to the 3 Ls: learning, liberty, leverage. First you learn about a problem then you liberate the mind from doubt (clear vision), then you use leverage (i.e. capital but not always) to solve it.</p>
<p>Married to the game but not in love with all of it.</p>
